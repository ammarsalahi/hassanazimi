## ðŸ¤” ABOUT ME?
Sure!
_Studied software engineering and have a first class degree with honours in London. Started working with computers since the release of early Unix and MS-DOS when there weren't not graphical user interface operating systems. Started programming when 16 with PHP and JavaScript, working with XHTML and early CSS to create static websites. While learning, decided to make online tutorials which results to be an instructor in Udemy and Parsclick with many satisfied students._

_Mainly build web applications as a web developer. Built applications with PHP and MySQL, Ruby on Rails, Laravel, Node, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and AJAX. Don't like CMSs but I have worked with WordPress and Joomla. Apart from web, have Ruby, Git, Unix Bash and Regular Expression experience. Also working as a freelancer so you're welcome to contact to hire. The crazy thing is I also do programming in my free time._
